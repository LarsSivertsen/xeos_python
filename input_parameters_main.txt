40000           #N, number of eos computed
3002            #run_number, run number. All files made by this program will be stored in runs/run_number
1               #TOV, bool, if set to 1 (True), program solves the TOV equations.
0               #TOV_limit, bool, if set 0 (False), computes the TOV equations only until first maximum mass. If set to 1 (True) computes to last maximum mass if more local maximum exists
200             #N_low_dens, number of points used in the low density RMF EoS
100             #N_CFL, number of points used in the pure CFL phase.
1.5             #rho_max_low_dens, maximum density we integrate the RMF eos to in fm^-3
6.4             #rho_max_high_dens, maximum density we integrate the quark phase to in fm^-3
3               #dmu_q, the increment the chemical potential of quarks is increased per step
1               #dmu_q_factor, the step dmu_q gets divided by dmu_q_factor once the mixed phase is found to start
